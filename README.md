# Vishwam AI - Folk Fest Data Collection Frontend

üåü **Project Overview**  
This project is part of a data collection initiative by **Vishwam AI**, in collaboration with **Swecha Telangana** and **IIT**, aimed at building a localized Large Language Model (LLM) for India.  
Foreign LLMs often struggle to provide accurate local information due to lack of relevant local data.  
To solve this, Vishwam AI is building a local LLM focused on Indian culture, history, and knowledge.

As part of this effort, I specifically contributed by building the **Frontend for the "Folk Fest" Data Collection Platform**, where users can upload documents, audio files, images, and other relevant data related to folk festivals.

## ‚úÖ My Contribution

I contributed to this project by developing the **Folk Fest Frontend** using the provided API keys from Vishwam AI.  
My work included:

- Implementing a **Login with OTP Authentication System**.
- Designing a **Landing Page** where users can:
    - Upload documents
    - Upload audio files
    - Upload images and other types of files
- Integrating the frontend with Vishwam AI‚Äôs backend APIs for data submission.
- Ensuring the frontend is fully responsive and user-friendly.

This frontend serves as a critical tool to collect local data that will help train the local LLM to reflect authentic folk festival culture and traditions.
